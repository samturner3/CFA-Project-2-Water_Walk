### Problem Definition

#### Impress: Bill & Melinda Gates (social causes/global development)

In rural areas of developing countries, access to supplies and resources is usually many hours walk away. Sometimes once they arrive at these pick-up locations, they find that the resources or supplies have run out.

This time could have been better spent educating the people.

•	The average distance that women in Africa and Asia walk to collect water is 6 kilometres (OHCHR).

•	In Sub-Saharan Africa, women and girls spend 40 billion hours a year collecting water, equivalent to a year’s worth of labour by the entire workforce in France (UNWOMEN).

•	If girls are walking long distances to get water early morning, they are either not going to school or dropping out of school. 

•	According to a study in Tanzania, reducing the travel time to water from 30 minutes to 15 minutes increased girls’ school attendance by 12% (UN Water)


### Solution

My app aims to reduce un-necessary trips by the ‘water walkers’ by keeping track of and notifying the walkers of the supply stock levels.
They will check the app before heading out so they can make a better decision regarding if they should go to school on that day or walk for supplies.
